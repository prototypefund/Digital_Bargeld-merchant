@node introduction
@chapter Whom this manual is addressed to
This manual is addressed to people who want to integrate Taler
in their online shop. The goal is to install a Taler @emph{backend} and
make it communicate with your existing shop (the @emph{frontend}).
In Taler terminology, the backend is the component that provides RESTful
API to the frontend and that will do all the crypto work and communication
with the Taler exchange. In other words, the frontend will never directly
communicate with the exchange.
See official documentation@footnote{@*https://api.taler.net@*https://taler.net}
about Taler protocols.

@node dependencies
@chapter Needed libraries to build the backend

The following packages need to be installed, in order to provide the
backend all the libraries it depends on.

@itemize
@item GNUnet
@item Taler Exchange
@item libmicrohttpd
@item libjansson
@end itemize

@section Installing GNUnet
GNUnet provides the backend all the routines for doing: cryptography,
string manupulation, interfacing with DB, non-Taler specific JSON manupulation,
logging, operating system interfacing.

Downloading GNUnet:

@code{wget https://gnunet.org/gnunet0-10-1}

Provide the following dependencies:
@itemize
@item @code{libpq} for interfacing with the Postgresql database
@item libgcrypt
@item libjansson
@item libunistring
@item libcurl
@end itemize

Then configure GNUnet as follows:

@verbatim

# From GNUnet's top directory.
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure [--prefix=PFX] \
              [--with-libgcrypt-prefix=LIBGCRYPTPFX] \
	      [--with-libcurl=LIBCURLPFX] \
	      [--with-libjansson=LIBJANSSONPFX] \ #Warning #4746
	      [--with-libunistring-prefix=LIBUNISTRINGPFX] \
	      --without-idn \
	      --wit-zlib=no \
	      [--with-libcurl=LIBCURLPFX] \
	      [--with-postgresql=LIBPQPFX]
$ make
$ make install

@end verbatim
