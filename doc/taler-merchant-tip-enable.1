.SH NAME
taler\-merchant\-tip\-enable \- Tell Taler merchant backend about reserve funding for tipping

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B taler\-merchant\-tip\-enable
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtaler\-merchant\-tip\-enable\fP is a command line tool to inform the Taler merchant backend that a wire transfer was made to enable tipping from the backend.  Note that the command cannot check that the wire transfer was made correctly (with the correct wire subject and the specified amount), and will thus just trust the operator.  Enabling tipping at an instance without a wire transfer may cause visitors to receive unfunded tips and experience error messages.  You should read the manual chapter on tipping before using this command.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-a VALUE,  \-\-amount=VALUE"
Which amount was transferred into the reserve at the exchange.  Must be of the format CUR:VALUE.FRACTION.
.B
.IP "\-b URI,  \-\-backend=URI"
At which URI does the backend run that we are to inform about the availability of funding for tipping?
.B
.IP "\-C UUID,  \-\-credit-uuid=UUID"
What is the UUID of the wire transfer.  The backend will automatically detect if the same UUID is used repeatedly, and ignore multiple invocations.  Pass a UUID generated by the wire transfer of the bank.
.B
.IP "\-e TIMESTAMP,  \-\-expiration=TIMESTAMP"
When does the reserve expire.  Determining this value may today require information from the exchange operator.
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-i NAME, \-\-instance=NAME"
Name of the instance where tipping is to be enabled.  The instance must have the reserve (private) key and exchange URI already configured. Note that this command-line tool must also have access to the same configuration with the instance's private key in it.
.B
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Print version information.
