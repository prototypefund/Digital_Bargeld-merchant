This directory contains the files needed to implment a simple/debug merchant website.

Only tested on nginx. To run the website, it suffices to have all the files in the same
directory, to have PHP enabled, and to set the following two redirections:

1. your_site/certal/ => your_site/cert.php
2. your_site/payler/ => your_site/pay.php

File		|What implements
--------------------------------
o index.html	| The "negotiation" view, that is the form
		  that allows the user to choose the product to buy.

o checkout.php	| The "payment selection" that is the form
		  that allows the user to choose the payment method he wishes to use.
		  It also implements the request of certificate and its showing as a
		  popup window (by JavaScript in it). For debugging purposes, it has a
		  certificate hardcoded in it.

o cert.php	| Replies with a JSON certificate that is held in a 'session' variable.

o pay.php	| Actual receiving of money, plus it gives back a "fullfillment" page
		  that informs the user of his well ended deal.
