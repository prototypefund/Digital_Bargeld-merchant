    <h2>Welcome to the Taler "Toy" Demonstrator</h2>
    <div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
      <p>This "toy" website provides you with the ability to
        experience using the Taler payment system without using
        valuable currency.  Here, we guide you through the steps
        of installing a Taler wallet, withdrawing Taler coins and
        spending them at a merchant.  For this demonstrator, we
        will be using a "toy" currency, KUDOS.  However, please note that
        Taler is designed to work with ordinary currencies, such
        as Dollars or Euros, not just toy currencies.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Installing the Taler wallet</h2>
      <p>First, you need to install the Taler wallet browser extension.
         It is currently only available for Firefox.  If you run
         Firefox, simply click <a href="/extension">here</a>
         to download and install the extension.  You will have to 
         click on "allow" and "install" dialogs shown by Firefox.
         After that, the Taler logo should appear on the right side
         of your navigation bar.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation" id="installation-done" role="article" style="display:none;">
      <h2>Step 1: Installing the Taler wallet</h2>
      <p>Congratulations, you have installed the wallet correctly.
         You can now proceed with the next steps.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation" id="wire" role="article" style="display:none;">
      <h2>Step 2: Performing a wire transfer</h2>
      <p>The next step is to transfer currency to the mint to
         obtain Taler coins.  This is typically done using a 
         wire transfer.  However, as this is just a demonstrator,
         we will allow you to send the mint KUDOS coins using a simple
         form on this website instead.</p>
      <p>You begin by clicking on the Taler icon and selecting
         "Create reserve".  The extension will then display some
         hexadecimal reserve public key, which you should copy to the 
         clipboard.  After that, you can paste it into the form
         below.  When dealing with real currency, you would do
         the same, except that you would have to copy the string
         into the subject area for your wire transfer instead of 
         into this form.
      </p>
      <form id="reserve-form" name="tform" action="fake_wire_transfer.php" method="POST">
        <br>
        Paste your reserve public key here (right-click, "paste"):
        <br>
        <input type="text" name="reserve_pk"></input>
        <br>
        Amount to credit to your reserve:
        <br> 
        <select id="amount" name="kudos_amount">
          <option value="1">1 KUDOS</option>
          <option value="5">5 KUDOS</option>
          <option value="10">10 KUDOS</option>
          <option value="1000">1000 KUDOS</option>
        </select>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"></input>
        <br>
      </form>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation" id="payment" role="article" style="display:none;">
      <h2>Step 3: Select project to donate KUDOS to!</h2>
      <p>Now it is time to spend your hard earned KUDOS.
         For your convenience, we integrated a tiny "shop"  
         accepting KUDOS right here into this page.</p>     
      <p>Please choose a project and the amount of KUDOS you 
         wish to donate.</p>
      <form name="tform" action="checkout.php" method="POST">
        <div id="opt-form" align="left">
          <br>
          <input type="radio" name="group0" value="Taler" checked="true">Taler</input>
          <br>
          <input type="radio" name="group0" value="Tor">Tor</input>
          <br>
          <input type="radio" name="group0" value="GNUnet">GNUnet</input>
          <br>
          <select id="taler-donation" name="kudos-donation">
            <option value="1">1 KUDOS</option>
            <option value="6">5 KUDOS (*)</option>
            <option value="10">10 KUDOS</option>
          </select>
          <input type="submit" name="keyName" value="Donate!">
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>
      </form>
      <p>(*) To make it a bit more fun, the 5 KUDOS option
         is deliberately implemented with a fault: the merchant will try to
         make you donate 6 KUDOS instead of the 5 KUDOS you got to see.  But do
         not worry, you will be given the opportunity to review the
         final offer from the merchant in a window secured
         by the Taler extension.  That way, you can spot the 
         error before committing to an incorrect contract.</p>
