=== INTRODUCTION ===

This directory contain a Web server that listens for
requests addressed to the exchange, relays them to the
exchange, and returns a modified response to the caller.

The modifications are made to test error management in the
merchant, and are driven by a HTTP header that instructs the
proxy about the modifications to be made.

=== INVOCATION ===

After a successful 'make install', a command called 'taler-merchant-mitm'
is placed under <prefix>/bin - make sure PATH points at it.

To run the mitm, give the following commands:

$ taler-merchant-mitm --exchange URL [--port PORT]

The '--exchange' option is mandatory, telling the mitm where to
forward the requests addressed to the exchange.

The second option just sets the port number where the mitm
listens, defaulting to 5000.
