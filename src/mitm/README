=== INTRODUCTION ===

This directory contain a Web server that listens for
requests addressed to the exchange, relays them to the
exchange, and returns a modified response to the caller.

The modifications are made to test error management in the
merchant, and are driven by a HTTP header that instructs the
proxy about the modifications to be made.
