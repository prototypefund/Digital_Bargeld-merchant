 * #TMH_PARSE_post_cleanup_callback().
 *
 * @param connection the MHD connection
 * @param con_cls the closure (points to a `struct Buffer *`)
 * @param upload_data the POST data
 * @param upload_data_size number of bytes in @a upload_data
 * @param json the JSON object for a completed request
 * @return
 *    #GNUNET_YES if json object was parsed or at least
 *               may be parsed in the future (call again);
 *               `*json` will be NULL if we need to be called again,
 *                and non-NULL if we are done.
 *    #GNUNET_NO is request incomplete or invalid
 *               (error message was generated)
