Since the merchant's backend makes use of several routines that are native
to the mint (in particular, those aimed to parse JSON object in HTTP POSTs),
and since there is no possibility to export some of them in a shared library,
then the files in this directory need to be moved *inside* the mint/src/mint
directory in order to be compiled. Use 'copy.sh SRC DST' (STILL NOT TESTED)
to copy the files in the desired location.

Lastly, passing CFLAGS='-I/usr/include/postgresql' to ./configure seems to be
mandatory, in order to compile the merchant http daemon.
