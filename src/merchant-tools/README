** Taler Merchant Payments Generator **

=== INTRODUCTION ===

The tool contained in this directory is used to populate the
merchant's and exchange's database with fake payments.
It is mainly used for debugging applications that need some
payments to be in place.

It is mandatory to give it a config file that contains information
about the setup to target. Note that the merchant and the exchange
tun by this command will use their own config files, so just few values
are required for it to run.


=== COFIGURATION ===

Any config file must look like the following one.

[payments-generator]

# where on this machine the exchange listens; note that
# this exchange must be among the ones accepted by the
# merchant
exchange = http://localexchange/

# where on this machine the merchant listens
merchant = http://localshop/

# bank's URI of the customer who withdraws coins.
# Must be known by the exchange.
bank = http://localbank/

# must match an instance known by the merchant
instance = FSF

# must match the currency used by merchant and exchange
currency = EUR


=== INVOCATION ===

taler-merchant-generate-payments -c config/file.conf [-n ITERATIONS]

The -n option instructs the tools about how many iteration of all
the (internal) commands we want to execute.
