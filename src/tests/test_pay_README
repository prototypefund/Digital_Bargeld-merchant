The merchant's "/pay" facility can be tested either directly by querying the
backend or by querying the frontend (which in turn will query the backend).
Each file *.sample is sample JSON to POST to both components (with the '_backend'
named version being dedicated to just the backend).

Note: the sample 'deposit_permission_edate_backend.sample' contains the optional
'edate' field to the deposit permission (that field indicates the tollerated delay
by this merchant to receive funds relative to this payment)

The frontend test admits two versions of queries, as in the following examples:

  * curl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d@deposit_permission.sample \
    http://merchant-url/pay.php?cli_debug=yes

    (this form tests the whole communication between frontend and backend)

  * curl -d@deposit_permission.sample http://merchant-url/pay.php?backend_test=no

    (this form tests only the deposit permission enhancement made by the
    frontend, so it doesn't further connect to the backend to actually POST
    that data. By default, the frontend doesn't add the 'edate' field, so it
    is necessary to uncomment the related line of code to test this feature)

Finally, to POST to the backend, issue
  * curl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d@*_backend.sample http://backend-url/pay
