<p>Written by Brett Smith and Richard Stallman.
<br>
This part contains the text of the latest versions of the primary GNU
licenses: the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU Free Documentation License
(FDL). Though they are legal documents, they belong in this book of
essays because they are concrete expressions of the ideals of free
software.
</p>
<a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-4"></a>
<p>Software development for the GNU operating system began in 1984. Once
Richard Stallman had parts of the 
<a name="index-GNU-_0028see-also-both-software-and-GNU_0029-7"></a>
GNU system that were worth releasing, he
needed a license to release them under. Some free software licenses
already existed; these gave users permission to modify and
redistribute the software, but they also allowed using the code in
proprietary versions and proprietary programs. Using those licenses,
GNU would have failed to achieve its goal of delivering freedom to all
users, because middlemen would have converted the GNU code into
proprietary software.
</p>
<a name="index-copyleft-_0028see-also-copyright_0029-7"></a>
<p>So Stallman devised a license to assure every user the freedom to
modify and redistribute the software. It granted these permissions
under one key condition: whoever distributed the software must pass
along the authorization to modify and redistribute that same software,
along with the source code making it practical to do so. Stallman
coined the term &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo; (see &ldquo;What Is Copyleft?&rdquo; on
p.&nbsp;@refx{Copyleft-pg}{) to describe this key twist of using the legal
power of copyright to ensure freedom for all users.
</p>
<p>GNU copyleft licenses were first developed for software, and later for
related areas such as software documentation. In them, the principles
of the free software movement, explained throughout the essays in this
book, take practical form. Each of their successive revisions has had
to wrestle with free software&rsquo;s legal and practical obstacles and
offers numerous illustrations of how free software ideals are codified
into legal terms.
</p>
<a name="The-Origins-of-the-GPL"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> The Origins of the GPL </h3>

<a name="index-GPL_002c-introduction-to-2"></a>
<p>The first version of the GNU General Public License was published in
1989&mdash;but Stallman had been releasing software under
copyleft licenses as part of the GNU Project since as early as 1985.
Prior to 1989, each published GNU program had been covered by a
license specifically tailored for it. Instead of a single GNU General
Public License, there was a 
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-CC-General-Public-License"></a>
<a name="index-GNU-CC-General-Public-License"></a>
GNU CC General Public License, a 
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GDB-General-Public-License"></a>
<a name="index-GDB-General-Public-License"></a>
GDB
General Public License, and so on. These licenses were identical
except for minor differences: for instance, terms about displaying
license notices to users were different for different programs and,
unless it covered a program that was just one source file, each
license contained the name of the program it applied to.
</p>
<p>By 1989, Stallman had had enough experience with different GNU
packages under slightly different licenses to conclude that it was
crucial to unify them into one license that would cover all these
packages. He worked with 
<a name="index-Cohen_002c-Jerry"></a>
Jerry Cohen, an attorney at 
<a name="index-Perkins-Smith-_0026-Cohen-LLP"></a>
Perkins Smith
&amp; Cohen&nbsp;LLP, to collect concepts from all the different licenses
written up to that point, and bring them together into one license.
It was thus that on 1&nbsp;February&nbsp;1989 the GNU General Public License
was born.
</p>
<p>The first version of the license sought to ensure two results: first,
that all derived works of the software would be released under the
same license and, second, that everyone who received the software
would have a chance to get the source code. These requirements
implement a strong copyleft by blocking the three main ways of making
programs proprietary: with copyright, with end user license
agreements, and by not distributing source code.
</p>
<p>In comparison to the program-specific licenses that had preceded it,
GPL version&nbsp;1 featured few substantial changes&mdash;the GPL was
evolutionary, not revolutionary&mdash;but it made a big practical
difference. Previously, developers who had wanted to copyleft a
program had needed to tailor one of the existing licenses to that
program. Many had not bothered. With the release of the GPL, those
developers had a license they could use out of the box to provide all
of their users with freedom to share and change the software. It was a
powerful tool.
</p>
<a name="Version-2"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Version&nbsp;2 </h3>

<a name="index-patents_002c-GPL-version-2-and"></a>
<a name="index-GPL_002c-introduction-to-3"></a>
<p>After the 1981 
<a name="index-Supreme-Court_002c-US-3"></a>
US Supreme Court decision in 
<a name="index-patents_002c-Diamond-v_002e-Diehr"></a>
<cite>Diamond v. Diehr,</cite> the 
<a name="index-Patent-and-Trademark-Office_002c-US"></a>
<a name="index-patents_002c-US-Patent-and-Trademark-Office"></a>
<a name="index-trademarks_002c-US-Patent-and-Trademark-Office"></a>
US Patent and Trademark Office began issuing patents for software.
Software patents threaten free software and proprietary software alike
(see part IV in this book), and Stallman realized that they could
subvert the copyleft in the GNU GPL.
</p>
<p>By selectively issuing patent licenses, patent holders can arbitrarily
control how the software under them is distributed or modified. A
patent holder can give one party permission to resell the program,
another permission to develop and use a modified version at her
company, and a third permission to do all the activities that the GPL
itself allows. They can demand whatever they wish in exchange for
these permissions. They have this power over any software that
implements the patented idea, whether or not they have modified or
distributed it themselves. This power threatens free software because
third parties with patents can impose restrictions on free software
users and developers.
</p>
<p>If patent holders don&rsquo;t distribute or modify software, then a software
license based on copyright like the GPL can&rsquo;t control their
activities: they haven&rsquo;t done anything that requires permission under
the license. But the software license can stop each of the program&rsquo;s
distributors from entering limiting agreements with the patent holder.
Enter GPL version&nbsp;2: a new section in the license (sec. 7)
explicitly says that if parties are subject to other legal
agreements&mdash;such as a patent license&mdash;that contradict the
GPL&rsquo;s terms, then the licensee must refrain from distributing the
software at all. As a result, any party that wants to distribute or
modify the software, and also obtain a patent license, must ensure
that the terms of that license are consistent with all of the GPL&rsquo;s
conditions: recipients of the software must receive it under the same
terms, with no additional restrictions, and have the means to get the
source code.
</p>
<a name="index-GPL_002dcovered-software-_0028see-also-software_0029-2"></a>
<a name="index-GPL_002c-GPL_002dcovered-software-_0028see-also-software_0029-2"></a>
<p>This new section protected the integrity of the distribution system
for GPL-covered software. A fundamental principle of the license is
that every licensee, from the most humble individual to the largest
corporation, has the exact same rights to share and change the
software. Patent holders who do not distribute the software themselves
and selectively issues patent licenses could potentially interfere
with this goal, splitting licensees into different groups however they
see fit. Section 7 of GPL version&nbsp;2 prevents this abuse.
<a name="index-GPL_002c-introduction-to-4"></a>
</p>
<a name="The-LGPL"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> The LGPL </h3>

<a name="index-LGPL_002c-introduction-to"></a>
<a name="index-libraries-_0028comp_002e_0029_002c-LGPL-and-1"></a>
<p>The GPL worked well for the programming tools, utilities, and 
<a name="index-games_002c-GPL-and"></a>
games
that were released by the GNU Project in the early years; however,
Stallman recognized that releasing the recently developed 
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-C-Library-4"></a>
GNU C
Library the same way could backfire. Aside from some extensions, the
GNU C Library was to be a compatible replacement for the UNIX C
Library, so any 
<a name="index-C-programs-1"></a>
C program would be able link with either one. If
proprietary C programs were not allowed to use the GNU C Library, they
would simply use the UNIX library. Being strict in this case would
gain nothing.
</p>
<p>Stallman decided to compromise with a modified copyleft: one that
would protect the freedom of the library itself, but not that of the
programs that use it. This idea was implemented in a license
originally called the GNU Library General Public License, first
published as version&nbsp;2.0, in June 1991. The original LGPL stated
Conditions like the GPL&rsquo;s&mdash;with an important exception: if
someone else&rsquo;s program used the library only by referring to it as a
library, that program&rsquo;s source could be distributed under license
terms of the author&rsquo;s choosing. However, the executable made by
combining the program and the library had to come with a copy of the
LGPL and source code for the library, and provide some mechanism for
users who have modified the library to update the executable to use
their modified library.
</p>
<p>How does a developer use the work as a library in order to take
advantage of the special set of conditions provided by LGPLv2? Think
of a computer program as a series of instructions for doing a
particular job: compiling or linking the program with a library
provides the programmer with a means to say, &ldquo;When the program gets to
this point, get further instructions from the library, and come back
here when those are done.&rdquo; Libraries are commonly used in software
development because they make the effort less repetitive and less
error prone: programmers don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel&mdash;and
perhaps introduce bugs in the process&mdash;every time they want to
accomplish a particular task. Because libraries are so widely created
and used, developers have the means to readily take advantage of the
LGPL&rsquo;s additional permissions.
</p>
<p>Version&nbsp;2.0 of the license worked as intended: in some situations,
proprietary software developers chose to use an LGPL-covered library
over a proprietary alternative, and users received the freedom to
share and change that library. This did not produce an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;
outcome&mdash;where the user had complete control over the entire
program&mdash;but in these cases the GPL would not have achieved that
ideal outcome either. The LGPL assured the users some freedom where
they would have otherwise had none.
</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Library GPL&rdquo; led some free software developers to assume all
libraries ought on principle to be licensed this way, but that was not
the intent&mdash;when a free library has no proprietary competitor,
releasing it under the GNU GPL can benefit free software. To avoid
this unintended message, Stallman renamed this license to the Lesser
General Public License, and incremented the version number to 2.1 to
reflect the relatively minor changes in the text: the license sported
a new preamble, a few wording clarifications, and allowed programs to
make their calls to the library through special system facilities for
shared libraries where those are available. The Lesser General Public
License version&nbsp;2.1 was released in February 1999.
<a name="index-LGPL_002c-introduction-to-1"></a>
<a name="index-libraries-_0028comp_002e_0029_002c-LGPL-and-2"></a>
</p>
<a name="The-FDL"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> The FDL </h3>

<a name="index-FDL_002c-introduction-to"></a>
<a name="index-manuals_002c-FDL-and-1"></a>
<p>At the turn of the century, free software was growing much faster than
it had been previously; the documentation, however, was not keeping
pace. Stallman was concerned about this failure and wrote about it in
&ldquo;Free Software Needs Free Documentation&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;@refx{Free Doc-pg}{).
</p>
<p>While there are some similarities between software and
documentation&mdash;they are both works that are meant for practical
use&mdash;there are important differences in the ways they can be
used. The GPL and the LGPL were not suitable for manuals.
</p>
<p>For some time, GNU packages had been using an untitled, simple, ad hoc
copyleft license for each manual. Since each manual&rsquo;s license was
different, text could not be copied from one manual to another. So
Stallman wrote the GNU Free Documentation License, a copyleft license
designed primarily for software documentation and other practical
written works.
</p>
<p>The FDL was first published in March 2000. The principles of the
copyleft remain the same: everyone who receives a copy of the work
should be able to modify and redistribute it. Where the FDL differs
from the software licenses is in the details of its implementation:
conditions about how to attribute the work and provide &ldquo;source
code&rdquo;&mdash;an editable version of the document&mdash;are different.
</p>
<a name="Version-3"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Version&nbsp;3 </h3>

<a name="index-GPL_002c-introduction-to-5"></a>
<p>During the 1990s, as free software became more popular, the GPL
emerged as the clear copyleft license of choice for the community, and
was adopted by the majority of free software projects; at the same
time, however, proprietary developers had come up with methods of
effectively denying users the freedoms that the GPL was meant to
protect, without actually violating the GPL. In addition, there were
other practices that the GPL did not handle conveniently. To deal
with these issues called for an updated version of the license.
</p>
<p>Around 2002, Stallman and others at the Free Software Foundation began
discussing how to update the GPL, and the LGPL along with it. The FSF
established a public review process, run with help from attorneys at
the Software Freedom Law Center, to catch possible problems before
actually releasing the new licenses. Committees of advisors from the
community studied issues raised by public comments and reported the
various positions and arguments to Stallman, who decided what policy
to adopt; then he wrote license text with advice and suggestions from
the attorneys. The importance of the changes made are explained in
&ldquo;Why Upgrade to GPLv3&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;@refx{Why V3-pg}{).
<a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-5"></a>
</p>
<a name="index-patents_002c-GPL-version-3-and"></a>
<p>Version&nbsp;3 used new terminology to promote uniform interpretations in
different jurisdictions, and modified some requirements to fit new
practices in the free software community. Beyond that, it introduced
several new conditions to strengthen the copyleft and thereby the free
software community as a whole. For instance, it
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a name="index-copyleft_002c-modified-versions-3"></a>
 blocked distributors from restricting users by building hardware
 that rejects the users&rsquo; modified versions 
<a name="index-tivoization-1"></a>
(&ldquo;tivoization&rdquo;);

</li><li>
 allowed code to carry limited additional requirements, for
 compatibility with some other popular free software licenses;

</li><li>
 and strengthened patent requirements by providing clear terms to
 handle patent cross-licenses, which are common arrangements between
 large patent-holding companies.

</li></ul>

<p>Both GPLv3 and LGPLv3 included terms to address all of these issues,
and were finally released on 29&nbsp;June&nbsp;2007. These licenses are the
state of the art in copyleft, going farther than any other software
license to protect users&rsquo; freedom and bring about a world in harmony
with the ideals expressed in this book.
