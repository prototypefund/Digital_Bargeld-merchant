<a name="index-JavaScript-2"></a>
<a name="index-traps_002c-JavaScript"></a>
<p>In the free software community, the idea that nonfree programs
mistreat their users is familiar. Some of us refuse entirely to
install proprietary software, and many others consider nonfreedom a
strike against the program. Many users are aware that this issue
applies to the plug-ins that browsers offer to install, since they can
be free or nonfree.
</p>
<p>But browsers run other nonfree programs which they don&rsquo;t ask you
about or even tell you about&mdash;programs that web pages contain or
link to. These programs are most often written in JavaScript, though
other languages are also used.
</p>
<p>JavaScript (officially called 
<a name="index-ECMAScript"></a>
ECMAScript, but few use that name) was
once used for minor frills in web pages, such as cute but inessential
navigation and display features. It was acceptable to consider these
as mere extensions of 
<a name="index-HTML-1"></a>
HTML markup, rather than as true software; they
did not constitute a significant issue.
</p>
<p>Many sites still use JavaScript that way, but some use it for major
programs that do large jobs. For instance, 
<a name="index-Google-Docs-1"></a>
Google Docs downloads into
your machine a JavaScript program which measures half a megabyte, in a
compacted form that we could call Obfuscript because it has no
comments and hardly any whitespace, and the method names are one
letter long. The source code of a program is the preferred form for
modifying it; the compacted code is not source code, and the real
source code of this program is not available to the user.
</p>
<p>Browsers don&rsquo;t normally tell you when they load JavaScript programs.
Most browsers have a way to turn off JavaScript entirely, but none of
them can check for JavaScript programs that are nontrivial and
nonfree. Even if you&rsquo;re aware of this issue, it would take you
considerable trouble to identify and then block those programs.
However, even in the free software community most users are not aware
of this issue; the browsers&rsquo; silence tends to conceal it.
</p>
<p>It is possible to release a JavaScript program as free software, by
distributing the source code under a free software license. But even
if the program&rsquo;s source is available, there is no easy way to run your
modified version instead of the original. Current free browsers do
not offer a facility to run your own modified version instead of the
one delivered in the page. The effect is comparable to 
<a name="index-tivoization-4"></a>
tivoization,
although not quite so hard to overcome.
</p>
<p>JavaScript is not the only language web sites use for programs sent to
the user. 
<a name="index-Flash"></a>
Flash supports programming through an extended variant of
JavaScript. We will need to study the issue of Flash to make suitable
recommendations. Silverlight seems likely to create a problem similar
to Flash, except worse, since Microsoft uses it as a platform for
nonfree codecs. A free replacement for 
<a name="index-Silverlight-_0028see-also-Microsoft_0029"></a>
Silverlight does not do the job
for the free world unless it normally comes with free replacement codecs.
</p>
<a name="index-Java-3"></a>
<p>Java applets also run in the browser, and raise similar issues. In
general, any sort of applet system poses this sort of problem. Having
a free execution environment for an applet only brings us far enough
to encounter the problem.
</p>
<p>A strong movement has developed that calls for web sites to
communicate only through formats and protocols that are free (some say
&ldquo;open&rdquo;); that is to say, whose documentation is published and which
anyone is free to implement. With the presence of programs in web
pages, that criterion is necessary, but not sufficient. JavaScript
itself, as a format, is free, and use of JavaScript in a web site is
not necessarily bad. However, as we&rsquo;ve seen above, it also isn&rsquo;t
necessarily OK. When the site transmits a program to the user, it is
not enough for the program to be written in a documented and
unencumbered language; that program must be free, too. &ldquo;Only free
programs transmitted to the user&rdquo; must become part of the criterion
for proper behavior by web sites.
</p>
<p>Silently loading and running nonfree programs is one among several
issues raised by &ldquo;web applications.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;web
application&rdquo; was designed to disregard the fundamental
distinction between software delivered to users and software running
on the server. It can refer to a specialized client program running
in a browser; it can refer to specialized server software; it can
refer to a specialized client program that works hand in hand with
specialized server software. The client and server sides raise
different ethical issues, even if they are so closely integrated that
they arguably form parts of a single program. This article addresses
only the issue of the client-side software. We are addressing the
server issue separately.
</p>
<p>In practical terms, how can we deal with the problem of nonfree
JavaScript programs in web sites? Here&rsquo;s a plan of action.
</p>
<p>First, we need a practical criterion for nontrivial JavaScript
programs. Since &ldquo;nontrivial&rdquo; is a matter of degree, this is
a matter of designing a simple criterion that gives good results,
rather than determining the one correct answer.
</p>
<p>Our proposal is to consider a JavaScript program nontrivial if it
makes an 
<a name="index-AJAX-request"></a>
AJAX request, and consider it nontrivial if it defines
methods and either loads an external script or is loaded as one.
</p>
<p>At the end of this article we propose a convention by which a
nontrivial JavaScript program in a web page can state the URL where
its source code is located, and can state its license too, using
stylized comments.
</p>
<p>Finally, we need to change free browsers to support freedom for
users of pages with JavaScript. First of all, browsers should be able
to tell the user about nontrivial nonfree JavaScript programs, rather
than running them. Perhaps 
<a name="index-NoScript"></a>
NoScript could be adapted to do this.
</p>
<p>Browser users also need a convenient facility to specify JavaScript
code to use <em>instead</em> of the JavaScript in a certain page.
(The specified code might be total replacement, or a modified version
of the free JavaScript program in that page.) 
<a name="index-Greasemonkey"></a>
Greasemonkey comes close
to being able to do this, but not quite, since it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee to
modify the JavaScript code in a page before that program starts to
execute. Using a local proxy works, but is too inconvenient now to be
a real solution. We need to construct a solution that is reliable and
convenient, as well as sites for sharing changes. The GNU Project
would like to recommend sites which are dedicated to free changes
only.
</p>
<p>These features will make it possible for a JavaScript program included
in a web page to be free in a real and practical sense. JavaScript
will no longer be a particular obstacle to our freedom&mdash;no more than
C and 
<a name="index-Java-4"></a>
Java are now. We will be able to reject and even replace the nonfree
nontrivial JavaScript programs, just as we reject and replace nonfree
packages that are offered for installation in the usual way. Our
campaign for web sites to free their JavaScript can then
begin.

<h3 class="subheading"> Appendix: A Convention for Releasing Free JavaScript Programs </h3>
<a name="index-GPL_002c-releasing-JavaScript-programs-under"></a>

<p>For references to corresponding source code, we recommend
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="smallexample">
    // @source:

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>followed by the URL.
</p>
<p>To indicate the license of the JavaScript code embedded in a page, we
recommend putting the license notice between two notes of this form:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="smallexample">
    @licstart  The following is the entire license notice for the 
    JavaScript code in this page.
    ...
    @licend  The above is the entire license notice
    for the JavaScript code in this page.

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, all of this should be contained in a multiline comment.
</p>
<p>The GNU GPL, like many other free software licenses, requires distribution of a copy of the license with both source and binary forms of the program. However, the GNU GPL is long enough that including it in a page with a JavaScript program can be inconvenient. You can remove that requirement, for code that you have the copyright on, with a license notice like this:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="smallexample">
