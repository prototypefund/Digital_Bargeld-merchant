Here is the logic that creates dummy payments into the
merchant's DB, mainly used for debugging applications that
need some real data from the merchant backend. 

The tool taler-merchant-generate-payments needs three values:

1 exchange URL
2 merchant backend URL
3 bank URL
4 currency

The tool reads these values from #define'd macros, so you should
change them and recompile the code in order to make them fit your
needs.

We wish to get this tool reading those values via a config file!
