Files are organized in two main chunks: (1) the ones which implement
Taler "core" protocol and that must be used 'as is' by the merchants
willing to use Taler, and (2) examples of mrchants using files of (1).

In particular, the structure is such that:

- 'src/' contains the merchant "backend", a C piece of software which
  implements cryto routines and communication with the 'exchange'
- 'examples/' contains examples of merchants using Taler, as may be a
  simple donation shop or a blog
- 'copylib/' contains commons routines that any merchant using Taler
  needs; for example, some JavaScript which detects if the user has a
  Taler wallet installed
- 'doc/' contains documentation files, like TeXinfo
