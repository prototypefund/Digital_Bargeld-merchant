INSTALL
=======

This guide is for running the 'shop' example, which require PHP and is
served via nginx.

Assuming that your system has a working PHP, the following
pecl packages are needed (the preferred way to install them
is with the pecl package manager, and not via your distribution's):

pecl_http
propro
raphf

As for the versioning, our working setup is using:

PHP 5.6
pecl_http 2.4.3 stable
propro 1.0.0 stable
raphf 1.1.0 stable

You can now refer to the nginx configuration examples (nginx_example.conf)
in this directory

FILES
=====

This directory contains the files implementing the frontend of the new merchant architecture.

Only tested on nginx. To run the website, it suffices to have all the .php and .html files
in the same directory, and having PHP (with the extension 'pecl_http' enabled) enabled.
