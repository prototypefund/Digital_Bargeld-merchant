<h1 class="chapter"> 34. Free but Shackled: The Java Trap </h1>


<blockquote class="smallquotation"><p>Since this article was first published, on 12 April  2004, Sun has relicensed most of its Java platform reference
implementation under the GNU General Public License, and there is now
a free development environment for Java. Thus, the Java language as
such is no longer a trap.<br></p>
<p>You must be careful, however, because not every Java platform is
free. Sun continues distributing an executable Java platform which is
nonfree, and other companies do so too.<br></p>
<p>The free environment for Java is called IcedTea; the source code Sun
freed is included in that. So that is the one you should use. Many
GNU/Linux distributions come with IcedTea, but some include nonfree
Java platforms.<br></p>
<p>To reliably ensure your Java programs run fine in a free environment,
you need to develop them using IcedTea. Theoretically the Java
platforms should be compatible, but they are not compatible 100 percent.<br></p>
<p>In addition, there are nonfree programs with “Java” in their name,
such as JavaFX, and there are nonfree Java packages you might find
tempting but need to reject. So check the licenses of whatever
packages you plan to use. If you use Swing, make sure to use the free
version, which comes with IcedTea.<br></p>
<p>Aside from those Java specifics, the general issue described here
remains important, because any nonfree library or programming platform
can cause a similar problem. We must learn a lesson from the history
of Java, so we can avoid other traps in the future.<br></p></blockquote>

<p>If your program is free software, it is basically ethical—but
there is a trap you must be on guard for. Your program, though in
itself free, may be restricted by nonfree software that it depends
on. Since the problem is most prominent today for Java programs, we
call it the Java Trap.
</p>
<p>A program is free software if its users have certain crucial
freedoms. Roughly speaking, they are: the freedom to run the program,
the freedom to study and change the source, the freedom to
redistribute the source and binaries, and the freedom to publish
improved versions. (See “The Free Software Definition,” on p. @refx{Definition-pg}{.) Whether any given program in source form is free software
depends solely on the meaning of its license.
</p>
<a name="index-traps_002c-nonfree-dependencies"></a>
<p>Whether the program can be used in the Free World, used by people
who mean to live in freedom, is a more complex question. This is not
determined by the program’s own license alone, because no program
works in isolation. Every program depends on other programs. For
instance, a program needs to be compiled or interpreted, so it depends
on a compiler or interpreter. If compiled into byte code, it depends
on a byte-code interpreter. Moreover, it needs libraries in order to
run, and it may also invoke other separate programs that run in other
processes. All of these programs are dependencies. Dependencies may
be necessary for the program to run at all, or they may be necessary
only for certain features. Either way, all or part of the program
cannot operate without the dependencies.
</p>
<p>If some of a program’s dependencies are nonfree, this means that all
or part of the program is unable to run in an entirely free
system—it is unusable in the Free World. Sure, we could redistribute
the program and have copies on our machines, but that’s not much good
if it won’t run. That program is free software, but it is effectively
shackled by its nonfree dependencies.
</p>
<p>This problem can occur in any kind of software, in any language. For
instance, a free program that only runs on Microsoft
<a name="index-Windows-3"></a>
Windows is clearly useless in the Free World. But software that runs
on GNU/Linux can also be useless if it depends on other nonfree
software. In the past,
<a name="index-Motif-_0028see-also-LessTif_0029-3"></a>
Motif (before we had 
<a name="index-LessTif-_0028see-also-Motif_0029-3"></a>
LessTif) and 
<a name="index-Qt-3"></a>
Qt (before its developers made it free software) were major causes of
this problem. Most 3D video cards work fully only with nonfree
drivers, which also cause this problem. But the major source of this
problem today is Java, because people who write free software often
feel Java is sexy. Blinded by their attraction to the language, they
overlook the issue of dependencies and fall into the Java Trap.
</p>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GCJ"></a>
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-Classpath"></a>
<p>Sun’s implementation of Java is nonfree. The standard Java libraries
are nonfree also. We do have free implementations of Java, such as the
GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) and GNU Classpath, but they don’t support
all the features yet. We are still catching up.
</p>
<p>If you develop a Java program on Sun’s Java platform, you are liable
to use Sun-only features without even noticing. By the time you find
this out, you may have been using them for months, and redoing the
work could take more months. You might say, “It’s too much work to
start over.” Then your program will have fallen into the Java Trap;
it will be unusable in the Free World.
</p>
<p>The reliable way to avoid the Java Trap is to have only a free
implementation of Java on your system. Then if you use a Java feature
or library that free software does not yet support, you will find out
straightaway, and you can rewrite that code immediately.
</p>
<p>Sun continues to develop additional “standard” Java libraries, and
nearly all of them are nonfree; in many cases, even a library’s
specification is a trade secret, and Sun’s latest license for these
specifications prohibits release of anything less than a full
implementation of the specification. (See
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/JSPA2.pdf">http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/JSPA2.pdf</a>
and
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr129/j2me_pb-1_0-fr-spec-license.html">http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr129/j2me_pb-1_0-fr-spec-license.html</a>
for examples.)
<a name="index-Sun-Microsystems-3"></a>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, that specification license does permit releasing an
implementation as free software; others who receive the library can be
allowed to change it and are not required to adhere to the
specification. But the requirement has the effect of prohibiting the
use of a collaborative development model to produce the free
implementation. Use of that model would entail publishing incomplete
versions, something those who have read the spec are not allowed to
do.
</p>
<p>In the early days of the free software movement, it was impossible
to avoid depending on nonfree programs. Before we had the GNU C
compiler, every 
<a name="index-C-programs-2"></a>
C program (free or not) depended on a nonfree C
compiler. Before we had the 
<a name="index-GNU_002c-GNU-C-Library-5"></a>
GNU C library, every program depended on a
nonfree 
<a name="index-C-library-6"></a>
<a name="index-libraries-_0028comp_002e_0029_002c-C-6"></a>
C library. Before we had Linux, the first free kernel, every
program depended on a nonfree kernel. Before we had BASH, every 
shell
script had to be interpreted by a nonfree shell. It was inevitable
that our first programs would initially be hampered by these
dependencies, but we accepted this because our plan included rescuing
them subsequently. Our overall goal, a self-hosting 
<a name="index-GNU-_0028see-also-both-software-and-GNU_0029-8"></a>
GNU operating
system, included free replacements for all those dependencies; if we
reached the goal, all our programs would be rescued. Thus it happened:
with the GNU/Linux system, we can now run these programs on free
platforms.
</p>
<p>The situation is different today. We now have powerful free
operating systems and many free programming tools. Whatever job you
want to do, you can do it on a free platform; there is no need to
accept a nonfree dependency even temporarily. The main reason people
fall into the trap today is because they are not thinking about
it. The easiest solution to the problem is to teach people to
recognize it and not fall into it.
</p>
<p>To keep your Java code safe from the Java Trap, install a free Java
development environment and use it. More generally, whatever language
you use, keep your eyes open, and check the free status of programs
your code depends on. The easiest way to verify that a program is free
is by looking for it in the Free Software Directory
(<a href="http://fsf.org/directory">http://fsf.org/directory</a>). If a program is not in the
directory, you can check its license(s) against the list of free
software licenses
(<a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>).
</p>
<p>We are trying to rescue the trapped Java programs, so if you like
the Java language, we invite you to help in developing GNU
Classpath. Trying your programs with the GCJ Compiler and GNU
Classpath, and reporting any problems you encounter in classes already
implemented, is also useful. However, finishing GNU Classpath will
take time; if more nonfree libraries continue to be added, we may
never have all the latest ones. So please don’t put your free software
in shackles. When you write an application program today, write it to
run on free facilities from the start.
