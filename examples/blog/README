This guide is for running the 'blog' example, which require PHP and is
served via nginx.

Assuming that your system has a working PHP, the following
pecl packages are needed (the preferred way to install them
is with the pecl package manager, and not via your distribution's):

pecl_http
propro
raphf

As for the versioning, our working setup is using:

PHP 5.6
pecl_http 2.4.3 stable
propro 1.0.0 stable
raphf 1.1.0 stable

You can now refer to the nginx configuration examples (nginx_example.conf)
in this directory
