This project contains code under two different licenses.

The merchant's backend (i.e. all the code in src/backend/)
is under the GNU GPLv3+ and/or the GNU Affero GPL as it
depends on libgnunetutil.  Note that the use of the Affero
GPL has little impact as the backend is not supposed to be
directly accessible to the Internet).  The license for this
code is in COPYING.GPL and COPYING.AGPL.

The merchant's frontend logic (i.e. JavaScript interacting with
the wallet, sample code for a shop) is under the GNU LGPL (but
we may choose to change this to be in the public domain or
BSD-licensed if necessary; the code is so short that there is
anyway the question whether it is copyrightable).  The license
text for this code is in COPYING.LGPL.


In examples/blog/articles/ we included a book by Richard Stallman.
It comes with its own permissive license (see COPYING in the
directory).
