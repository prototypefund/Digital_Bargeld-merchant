This project contains code under two different licenses.

The merchant's backend (i.e. all the code in src/backend/)
is under the GNU GPLv3+ and/or the GNU Affero GPL as it
depends on libgnunetutil.  Note that the use of the Affero
GPL has little impact as the backend is not supposed to be
directly accessible to the Internet).  The license for this
code is in COPYING.GPL and COPYING.AGPL.

The merchant's library logic (src/lib/) is under the GNU LGPL (but we
may choose to change this to be in the public domain or BSD-licensed
if necessary).  Under this same license, it comes the merchant library
(src/lib/) as it can be linked with more diverse licensed software.
The license text for this code is in COPYING.LGPL.
